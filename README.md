**Heart Disease Prediction ML Model**
This project implements a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various input features. The model is deployed as a user-interactive web application using Python and Streamlit.

**Features**
The model takes into consideration the following 13 input features:

1)Age
2)Current smoker status
3)Number of cigarettes per day
4)Blood pressure medication status
5)History of stroke
6)Prevalent hypertension status
7)Diabetes status
8)Total cholesterol level
9)Systolic blood pressure
10)Diastolic blood pressure
11)Body Mass Index (BMI)
12)Heart rate
13)Glucose level

**Usage**
To use the application, follow these steps:

Install the necessary dependencies by running **_pip install -r requirements.txt._**
Run the application using **_streamlit run app.py._**
Enter the required information for each input feature.
Click the _**"Predict"**_ button to obtain the prediction.

**Development Environment**
IDE: Jupyter Lab
Web Framework: Streamlit
Programming Language: Python
